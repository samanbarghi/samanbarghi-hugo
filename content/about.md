Saman Barghi is currently a PhD student of Computer Science at University of Waterloo. He is currently researching on concurrent and parallel programming models, specially for highly scalable network servers. He is trying to find a sweet spot between thread-based programming model and event-driven model; this model will use various hardware characteristics and stage driven model to provide an scalable alternative to current available models. Currently, he is developing a user thread library in C++ that supports x86\_64 machines and can provide a __M:N__ threading model on Linux.

He is also a full stack developer, interested in learning new technologies, and
apply them to create interesting products. He believe that learning any new
technology should not take more than a month to master, and believes investing
time in choosing the right tools and come up with a good design in the beginning
will translate to saving time in the future; if one do not get stuck
in that process forever.

He is a calisthenics addict and dedicates some time in his schedule to build strength and reach
his goals. He believes a healthy diet and following a workout routine to reach
predefined goals will translate to developing strength, increasing health and
energy and helping you stay sharp and focused. He is also and adventurer, love
outdoors and nature.

Saman is always have a book close by, and is interested in subjects such as
behavioural economics, business building, personal growth, how brain works and
human interactions. He believes that not also gathering knowledge is essential to change your
point of view towards the world around you and to shine some light on the dark corners
of your mind, but also using his knowledge in day to day life towards
creating a better environment for himself and other human beings is what should
result from that knowledge. He is also interested in reading fiction, and
believes a good fiction will make the reader think, and make him live the life
of others and spend moments in their shoes, and will result in personal growth.

He is also play the guitar and paints with acrylic in his free time. He
believes in building a skill set in one dimension (Computer Science), and occasionally touching other
dimensions, specially art, to be able to view the world through that window. He
always tries to keep an open mind regarding the subjects around him, and
reevaluate his believes and ideas frequently.
