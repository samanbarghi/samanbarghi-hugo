Saman Barghi is currently a Senior Software Engineer at
Twitter working with the platform team solving distributed system problems at Twitter scale.
Previously, he was working as a Senior Software Engineer at Bloomberg solving distributed system probelms.

He got his PhD from University of Waterloo and was researching on concurrent and
parallel programming models, specially for highly scalable network servers. He
is trying to find a sweet spot between thread-based programming model and
event-driven model; this model will use various hardware characteristics and
stage driven model to provide an scalable alternative to current available
models. He developed a user thread library in C++ that supports
x86\_64 machines and can provide a __M:N__ threading model on Linux.


Saman is interested in topics such as, concurrency and parllelism, distributed systems and cloud computing, 
compilers and programming languages.
